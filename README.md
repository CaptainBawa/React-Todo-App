# 📖 React To-Do List App <a name="about-project"></a>

**React To Do List App** is a simple application built using the React.js library that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks to a list. The app uses a single-page application (SPA) architecture and leverages React's state management capabilities to update the UI in real-time as users interact with the app. The To-Do List App also uses React's component-based architecture, allowing developers to build reusable UI components that can be easily composed and reused throughout the app. The app is typically built using modern JavaScript tools like Webpack and Babel, and can be deployed to a variety of hosting platforms. The App is a great example of how to build a modern, responsive, and scalable web application using the React.js library.
